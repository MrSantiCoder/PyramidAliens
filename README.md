# PyramidAliens
Here is my game PyramidAliens
Make sure you swith to the "master" branch to see where the code and sprite files are.
There is still a lot of functionality to be added to the game such as new levels, a main menu, better enemy movement... 
The basic controls for the game are:
  -AWSD for the player movement
  -SPACEBAR for shooting energy balls
  -ESC to exit the game
The game doesn't exit when you kill all the enemies which is also functionality I will be adding soon
The most important thing I'm currently working on right now is a way to automatically spawn enemies instead of creating instances of enemy to spawn every one of them (I am aware this is a bad practice)
The game was made on Sublime, it is unlikely that it might not work using another IDE or text editor but if that's the case try using Sublime and pressing Ctrl+B to start the game.
